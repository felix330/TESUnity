*TESUnity VR*
==========

World viewer for Elder Scrolls games in the Unity game engine. This is an experimental VR implementation for Open VR by felix330. All credit for TESUnity goes to ColeDeanShepherd.


Getting Started
---------------

**TESUnity requires a valid installation of Morrowind to run!**

**Big endian CPUs are currently not supported!**

To get started, download the source code as a ZIP file, extract it, and open the TESUnity folder in Unity. Please make sure SteamVR is running and the controllers are connected before you start the game.


Controls
--------

Right now, only flying is implemented as a movement method. Walking will come later. I don't recommend trying the current version if you are prone to motion sickness.

Left Touchpad to control flight direction based on where you look.

Left + Right triggers for 90Â° comfort-turning
